Mediation is an effective tool to put an end to our problems gracefully without facing fierce legal battles stretched over several years. Moreover, litigation between parties entails a lot of costs and more importantly it wastes a lot of precious time of the parties. Litigation has a long route and keeping this in mind even our Hon’ble Courts are supporting and encouraging settlement of cases through mediation as far as possible.Mediation facilitates settlement of disputes by giving space to the parties in which they can reflect upon themselves and their differences in an altogether different manner. The Mediator initiates fresh round of discussion and dialogue between parties which usually they are not able to do without the presence of third neutral party. Mediation acts as a mirror for its clients where parties can reflect upon themselves and think deeply to figure out possible solutions to their problems. As a Mediator, I have worked with parties that are not able to talk without the presence of a third party. In such situations, I may structure the conversation, ask such questions that are intended to create focus, clarify differences, standpoints and interests, and shift the perspective of the parties towards each other. In the process of mediation, communication amongst the parties is challenging and may take an aggressive form but as a Mediator, I stand between the parties, filtering, their words and actions. As a Mediator, I acknowledge the feelings of the parties, their thoughts, their discomfort and inhibitions. But despite all this, I strive to create a conducive environment to continue and conclude their talks.

With technology being highly accessible and while humans are well educated on most topics/subjects, a mediator's role has become imperative to guide interaction between humans. As discussions take place and each party listens to each other, they develop new understandings of the situation and are able to better assess the issues in hand and make their own decisions. The decisions are driven by allowing parties to see the dispute from the other party’s perspective. The outcome is purely in the Clients hands and dependent on their own choices.

I am willing to bring creative processes into the mediation, such as using poetry as a tool for effective mediation, to help this communication and understanding between parties to enable them to preserve their relationships as well as safeguard their interests.

The project was created in response to the historical conflict between the two religious groups with the aim to bridge their divide by inviting dialogue about their differences and building relationships. That is when I started to develop what is now my passion for dispute resolution outside of court. I strongly believe in the benefits of collaborative negotiation, engaging in mediation and other ADR processes, which involve a better use of resources by de-escalating tension between the parties to explore a workable and mutually beneficial solution to their conflict. I am warm and collected with strong interpersonal skills and ability to create empathy in person and online, which allows the parties to feel relaxed and cooperative. I appreciate the importance of understanding different personalities and to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach to negotiation in the mediation process. I believe that the role of a mediator is much more than that of a messenger between the aggrieved parties. Instead, it involves the need for a pragmatic understanding of what is needed by the parties in an often very difficult and emotive process, to engage with and where appropriate, to challenge the parties to assist them with reaching the right agreement and not just any agreement.

Whether acting as mediator, negotiator or advocate, my view is that many disputes can be solved by discussion and negotiation. Litigation is expensive and always carries risk. In mediation the parties in dispute own the process, blame and fault can be examined but equal focus can be spent on mutually finding solutions & managing the future. My role as mediator is to make parties aware of that and guide them on the right path, with less focus upon winning and losing and more focus upon reaching a resolution that they have achieved themselves through discussion, negotiation and compromise – commercial disputes are almost always capable of commercial solutions.","[{'day': 'Monday', 'slots': ['09:00-11:00', '13:00-15:00', '16:00-18:00']}, {'day': 'Tuesday', 'slots': ['10:00-12:00', '14:00-16:00']}, {'day': 'Wednesday', 'slots': ['09:00-11:00', '13:00-15:00']}, {'day': 'Thursday', 'slots': ['10:00-12:00', '14:00-16:00', '17:00-19:00']}, {'day': 'Friday', 'slots': ['09:00-11:00', '12:00-14:00']}]",2024-05-26T09:44:17.436229,2024-05-26T09:44:17.436237

It was useful that you had your own thoughts on what might work to make progress and were thinking laterally about what part of any settlement could be. Pushing my client from time to time gave me some comfort that you were pushing our opponent too. It was not a mediation which was going to turn or required analysis on legal issues and it was useful that you steered clear of the minutiae of the case for that reason.
